🎯 Project Proposal: "StrideInsight - AI-Powered Retail Footfall Intelligence Platform"
🌟 Executive Summary
StrideInsight transforms existing CCTV infrastructure into a comprehensive retail intelligence system by analyzing customer movement patterns, dwell times, and demographic flows—WITHOUT facial recognition. Instead, it uses gait analysis, body posture, and movement patterns to understand customer behavior while maintaining complete privacy compliance.
Key Differentiator: Privacy-first approach using anonymous behavioral biometrics instead of facial data, making it legally safer and ethically superior.

💡 The Core Innovation
What Makes This Different?

No Facial Recognition - Uses gait signature and movement patterns
Session-Based Tracking - Tracks individuals only during store visit (no long-term storage)
Behavioral Value Scoring - Predicts purchase intent from body language and movement
Multi-Store Journey Mapping - Tracks customer flows across mall ecosystems


🎯 Problem Statement
Retailers Face:

Blind Inventory Decisions: Don't know which zones attract high-intent buyers
Inefficient Staff Allocation: Can't predict crowd patterns in advance
Lost Conversion Opportunities: Miss signals of purchase hesitation or interest
Wasted Marketing Spend: Place ads without knowing actual foot traffic quality

Current Solutions Fall Short:

Traditional people counters → Only quantity, not quality
Facial recognition systems → Privacy nightmares, legal risks
Manual observation → Not scalable, subjective, expensive

### What Gets Measured:

1. **Gait Biometrics** (Session-only)
   - Walking speed and rhythm
   - Stride length and body posture
   - Movement confidence patterns

2. **Behavioral Signals**
   - Dwell time per zone
   - Hesitation patterns (stops, backtracking)
   - Group dynamics (solo, couple, family)
   - Phone usage frequency

3. **Intent Scoring**
   - High Intent: Purposeful walking, direct product approach, long examination time
   - Medium Intent: Browsing pace, multiple stops, comparison behavior
   - Low Intent: Fast walking, minimal stops, phone-focused

4. **Demographic Estimation** (Non-invasive)
   - Age group (from gait/posture)
   - Gender probability (from movement patterns)
   - Physical mobility indicators
